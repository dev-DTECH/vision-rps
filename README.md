# Vision RPS
> [Live Preview!](https://vision-rps.devdt.xyz/)

A Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Machine Learning and Mediapipe’s hand tracking.
- Designed and implemented a Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Machine Learning using Mediapipe’s hand tracking.
- Collected a dataset of size 1329 using OpenCV and preprocessed it to our requirements. 
- Trained a classification model with a validation accuracy of 99.32% using TensorFlow and implemented it on website using TensorFlow.js.

## Running the project locally

### Clone the git repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dev-DTECH/vision-rps.git
cd ./vision-rps
```
### Run a HTTP Server
```shell
python -m http.server 8080

<a name="collect_data"></a>
## How to collect data
### Install the dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
### Run the collect data manual script
```shell
python collect_data_manual.py
```
> Press the keys from 0 to 9 as labels while showing your hand in the camera.
> It will generate a dataset and store it into data.csv

## Convert keras model to TensorFlow.js
### Install TensorFlow.js
```shell
pip install tensorflowjs
```
### Run the converter script
```shell
tensorflowjs_converter \                                         
    --input_format=keras \
    /models/v1.h5 \
    /models/v1_tfjs_model

```
